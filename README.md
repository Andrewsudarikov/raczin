# Raczin

This is mostly a learning project of a non-prorammer trying to learn Python.

> It's always better to learn while trying to build something constructive than to keep laboring through exercises.

Raczin is a mental arhithmetics app built with GTK+ and Elementary OS aestheitcs in mind. It is designed to look nice and provide some exercise for your brain. 

Most of its exercises are based on an old Russian mental arithmetic textbook written by [Sergey Raczinsky (RUS)](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Рачинский,_Сергей_Александрович), hence the name of the app.
