# Raczin
This is mostly a learning project of a non-prorammer trying to learn Python. 
> It's always better to learn while trying to build something constructive than to keep laboring through exercises.

Raczin is a mental arhythmetics app build with GTK+ and Elementary OS aestheitc in mind. It is designed to look nice and provide some exercise for your brain. 

Most of its exercises are based on an old Russian mental arithmetic textbook written by Alexander Raczinsky, thus the name of the app.
